Incorporated newly applied camera firmware which makes image byte order reversing needless.

OsParking (pronounced 'Oz' Parking, as in The Wizard of Oz) is an Open Source Parking Lot Management Software. In an extended sense, it is a term which describes a simulation package that includes OsParking(manager) and three device simulators(Camera, E-Board, GateBar).

OsParking software assumes the use of LPR (License Plate Recognition) module to recognize car tag numbers.
